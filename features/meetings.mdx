Kontor's Meeting Copilot handles the full meeting lifecycle — from preparation to follow-up — so you can focus on the conversation.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Calendar Sync">
    Kontor syncs your Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar automatically every 5 minutes. New meetings appear in your dashboard as soon as they're created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prep Brief">
    30 minutes before a meeting, Kontor generates a prep brief with context pulled from your emails, past meetings, and memories. The brief is delivered as a decision card in your queue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Recording">
    Approve the prep brief decision to enable recording. A notetaker bot joins the call 2 minutes before start and sends a consent message in the meeting chat. Available on paid plans (Solo, Pro, and Scale).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-Meeting Summary">
    After the meeting ends, Kontor generates a summary with key discussion points and action items. Follow-up email drafts are created automatically and appear in your Decision Queue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recording Limits

| Plan | Recordings / Month |
|------|-------------------|
| Free | 0 |
| Solo | 10 |
| Pro | 30 |
| Scale | 100 |

<Warning>Meeting recording requires a paid plan (Solo, Pro, or Scale). The notetaker bot will announce itself and request consent from all participants before recording begins.</Warning>

<Tip>Prep briefs are generated even on the Free plan — only recording requires an upgrade.</Tip>
