Kontor builds a knowledge base from your interactions. Over time, it learns your communication style, key contacts, project details, and preferences — making every response more relevant.

## What Gets Stored

- Communication preferences (tone, formality, language)
- Key contacts and relationships
- Project context and deadlines
- Meeting history and outcomes
- Your feedback on decisions (approvals, edits, rejections)

## Memory Tiers

Kontor organizes memories by how frequently they're needed:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **HOT** | Actively used, recent context. Retrieved on every interaction. |
| **WARM** | Referenced periodically. Retrieved when relevant to the current task. |
| **COLD** | Archived older context. Retrieved only when specifically relevant. |

Memories are automatically promoted or demoted between tiers based on usage.

## Privacy and Security

<Warning>Kontor automatically filters sensitive data from memory storage. API keys, passwords, credit card numbers, and other credentials are never stored in memory.</Warning>

- All memories are encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Memories are isolated to your account — no data is shared between users.
- You can view and delete individual memories from **Settings > Memory**.
