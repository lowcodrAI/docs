description: "Talk to Kontor in natural language to get things done."

Chat is your direct line to Kontor. Ask questions, give instructions, or request documents — all in natural language.

## What You Can Do

- Draft and send emails
- Summarize your inbox
- Generate documents (PDF, XLSX, PPTX, DOCX)
- Look up information across your connected tools
- Create meeting agendas
- Set reminders and follow-ups

## How It Works

You type a message, Kontor processes it using your connected integrations and memory, then responds with text or creates a decision card for actions that need your approval.

For example, asking "Draft a follow-up email to Sarah about the proposal" will generate an email draft that appears in your Decision Queue for review before sending.
