The Activity Log provides a chronological feed of every action Kontor has taken — emails sent, meetings scheduled, documents generated, and memories created.

## Filtering

Narrow down the feed by:

- **Action type** — emails, meetings, documents, memories
- **Date range** — today, this week, custom range
- **Integration** — Gmail, Calendar, Slack, and more

## Detail View

Tap any activity item to see full details, including the original decision that triggered it and the outcome.

<Tip>Use the Activity Log to audit Kontor's actions. Every action links back to the decision that triggered it, giving you a complete trail.</Tip>
