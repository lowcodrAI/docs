## Calendar Sync

Kontor syncs your connected calendars automatically every 5 minutes. There is nothing to configure — once your calendar is connected, meetings appear in your dashboard.

To manage which calendars are synced:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings > Meetings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View connected calendars">
    See which Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar accounts are synced.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disconnect or reconnect">
    Tap a calendar to disconnect it, or connect a new one from the Integrations page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recording Preferences

Configure how Kontor handles meeting recordings.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Auto-record | When enabled, Kontor automatically records meetings you approve via the prep brief decision card |
| Consent message | The notetaker bot sends a message in the meeting chat announcing it is recording and requesting consent |

<Tip>You can enable recording on a per-meeting basis by approving the prep brief decision card.</Tip>

## Recording Usage

Track how many meeting recordings you have used this month compared to your plan limit. View your current usage in **Settings > Meetings > Recording Usage**.

| Plan | Monthly Recording Limit |
|------|------------------------|
| Free | 0 |
| Solo | 10 |
| Pro | 30 |
| Scale | 100 |

When you reach your recording limit, new recordings are paused until your next billing cycle. Upgrade your plan for additional capacity.
