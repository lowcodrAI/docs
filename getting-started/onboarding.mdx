Kontor is designed to get you up and running with minimal setup. Follow these steps to create your account and start using your AI assistant.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Account">
    Visit [app.getkontor.com/signup](https://app.getkontor.com/signup) or download the Kontor app from the App Store. Enter your email and create a password to get started.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Your Email">
    Check your inbox for a 6-digit verification code. Enter it on the verification screen to confirm your account. The code expires after 10 minutes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Your Profile">
    Add your name, company, and role. This helps Kontor personalize its responses and tailor suggestions to your business context.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Your First Integration">
    Connect at least one tool to unlock Kontor's full potential. Gmail is a great starting point — it enables email drafting, follow-ups, and more. See [Connecting Integrations](/getting-started/connecting-integrations) for a walkthrough.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore the App">
    Your home screen shows the **Decision Queue** — where Kontor surfaces actions for your approval. Try the **Chat** tab to ask Kontor your first question.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Download the mobile app for the best experience. Kontor sends push notifications for new decisions, so you can approve actions on the go.
