## How Integrations Work

Kontor uses **OAuth** to securely connect to your existing tools. Your credentials are never stored — Kontor only receives scoped access tokens that limit what it can read and do. You can revoke access at any time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Navigate to the **Settings** tab and tap **Integrations**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a Tool">
    Browse available integrations by category: Email, Calendar, Communication, Productivity, CRM, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    Tap **Connect** and follow the OAuth prompt. Sign in with your existing account and grant the requested permissions. Kontor only requests the minimum scopes needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Using">
    Once connected, Kontor can read and act on data from that tool. Connected integrations appear with a green checkmark in your Settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Start with **Gmail** and **Google Calendar** for the best experience. These integrations unlock email drafting, meeting prep, and follow-ups.
</Tip>

## Managing Connections

You have full control over your connected integrations:

- **View connections** — See all active connections in **Settings > Integrations**.
- **Disconnect** — Remove any integration at any time by tapping **Disconnect**. Kontor will immediately lose access.
- **Reconnect** — If a token expires, Kontor will notify you. Tap the integration to re-authorize.

<Warning>
  Some integrations may require admin approval in your organization. Check with your IT team if you're using a work account.
</Warning>
