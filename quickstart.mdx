<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up at [app.getkontor.com](https://app.getkontor.com) or download the mobile app from the App Store. Verify your email address to activate your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your first integration">
    Go to **Settings > Integrations** and connect Gmail (or any tool you use daily). Authentication is handled via one-click OAuth — no API keys or passwords to copy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Kontor something">
    Open **Chat** and try a prompt like:
    - "Draft a follow-up email to my last meeting"
    - "Summarize my unread emails"
    - "Create a weekly status report from my Linear tasks"

    Kontor will pull context from your connected tools and get to work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve your first decision">
    Kontor creates a draft in your **Decision Queue**. Review the output, then swipe right to approve and send, left to edit, or up to snooze for later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Kontor gets smarter over time. The more you use it, the better it understands your preferences and communication style.
